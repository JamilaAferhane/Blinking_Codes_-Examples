# Arduino - LEDs Blinking
This repository contains Arduino code examples with images of the assembly and videos of the equipment executing the code. There are a total of 8 folders in this repository, each containing a different example.

# Folders and Descriptions
## 1. Two LEDs Blinking Alternately
This folder contains a code example that blinks two LEDs alternatively for one second each.

## 2. Two LEDs Blinking Alternately for different periods of time
This folder contains a code example that blinks two LEDs alternatively for one second for the first LED and two seconds for the second LED.

## 3. Two LEDs blinking simultaneously at an identical frequency
This folder contains a code example that blinks two LEDs at the same time with a frequency of 10 Hz.

## 4. Blinking LEDs with different frequencies
This folder contains two code examples:
  - The first one is about two LEDs blinking at different frequencies of 10 Hz and 5 Hz. 
  - The second one is about two LEDs blinking at different frequencies of 2 Hz and 5 Hz using the function millis() for measuring time.

## 5. Blinking LEDs with Timers
This folder contains a code example that blinks two LEDs at different frequencies by using ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) via a timer.

## 6. Blinking LEDs with Potentiometer and Buzzer
This folder contains a code example that uses the values of a potentiometer to vary the blinking frequency of two LEDs. A buzzer is also activated when the potentiometer value reaches certain values.

## 7. Blinking LEDs with Temperature and Humidity Sensor
This folder has two code examples:
   - The first code uses the temperature values measured by a DH11 sensor to vary the frequency of blinking of two LEDs. A buzzer is activated when the temperature value reaches 50°. 
   - The second code uses the humidity values measured by a DH11 sensor to vary the frequency of blinking of two LEDs. A buzzer is also activated when the humidity value reaches 80°.

## 8. LED Counter
This folder contains a code example that reads the state of two switches and increments a counter based on the state of the first switch. An LED is also controlled that turns on when the counter reaches 10.

# Conclusion
This repository provides various examples of Arduino code for beginners and advanced users. Each folder contains an Arduino code with images of the assembly and videos of the equipment executing the code. We hope that this repository will be helpful to the Arduino community.
